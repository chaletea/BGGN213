## What is in the PDB databse?

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv('pdb.csv', row.names = 1)
knitr::kable(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

The commas are converting values containing them to NA values

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", pdbstats$X.ray)))
n.xray
```

```{r}
n.em <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", pdbstats$EM)))
n.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", pdbstats$Total)))

round(((n.xray + n.em)/n.total), 2)
```

```{r}
rm_comma_sum <- function(filecolumn) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", filecolumn)))
}
```

```{r}
rm_comma_sum(pdbstats$X.ray)/rm_comma_sum(pdbstats$Total)
round(n.xray/n.total, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round((rm_comma_sum(pdbstats$Total[1])/n.total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

# Using the Molstar viewer

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure has only been resolved to 2 A, which is above the resolution needed to see hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

H 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend "Ball & Stick" for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# Let's do some bioinformatics

Use the bio3D package for structural bioinformatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
p <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```
```{r}
p
```
```{r}
head(p$atom)
```
```{r}
p$atom[1,'resid']
p$atom$resid[1]
aa321(p$atom$resid[1])
```

# Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)
```{r}
#Read an input structure
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```
```{r}
adk
```
```{r}
#NMA
m <- nma(adk)
```
```{r}
plot(m)
```

Make a video of this motion for Molstar
```{r}
#Make a trajectory file
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# PCA - Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

First, extract the sequence
```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```
```{r}
aa
```
```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
#hits <- plot(b)
# hits
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
# Align and Superimpose

```{r}
#Align related pdbs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile='msa')
```
```{r}
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)
graphics.off()
par(mar=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0))
plot(pdbs, labels=ids, width = 5, height = 4)
```


```{r}
#Run a PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
Make a trajectory of the displacements captured by PCA
```{r}
mktrj(pc.xray, pc = 1, file = "pc_1.pdb")
```
